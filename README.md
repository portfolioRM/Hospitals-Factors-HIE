# Hospitals and Health Information Exchanges (HIE)

## Project Summary:
For this project the research questions were:
1. ***What hospital factors are associated with having an HIE installed?***
2. ***Is having an HIE installed linked to better performance?***<br><br>

I combined five datasets detailed below to answer these questions:
- **American Hospital Association Data  2010 - 2017** : : *50,264 records - 86 variables*
- **HIMSS Demographics Data 2018** : : *5,594 records - 35 variables*
- **HIMSS Technology Data 2018** : : *1,048,575 records - 19 variables*
- **HIMSS HIE Data 2018** : : *6,491 records - 10 variables*
- **HIMSS Patient Survey Data 2018** : : *260,361 records - 28 variables*<br><br>
## Steps Involved:
- Creating Outline Block Models to Answer the Research Questions
- Selecting Variables from Data Description Files for Download Submission Request
- Merging the Data Sets
- Data Preparation, Cleaning, Reduction
- Data Exploration and Visualization
- Creating a Technology Score Data Variable from the HIMSS Technology Data
- Correlation and Significance Testing
- Building Logistic and Linear Regression Models to Answer the Research Questions
- Developing Insights from the Models<br><br>
